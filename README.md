# üöó Car Dheko Used Car Price Predictor

## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement
At Car Dheko, we strive to enhance the customer experience by making the used car buying and selling process seamless. One critical aspect is ensuring that our customers and sales representatives have access to accurate and real-time price estimates for used cars. The challenge lies in predicting these prices with precision, considering the various features of each car.

## üéØ Objective
The objective of this project is to create an accurate and user-friendly machine learning model that predicts the prices of used cars based on features like make, model, year, fuel type, transmission type, and more. This model will be deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application, enabling both customers and sales representatives to input car details and receive instant price estimates.

## üìù Project Scope
We have a rich dataset from Car Dheko, comprising historical prices of used cars along with various attributes from different cities. Your mission as a data scientist is to:

1. **Develop a robust machine learning model** to predict the prices of used cars based on the provided features.
2. **Integrate this model into a Streamlit web application** that allows users to input car details and receive an estimated price instantly.

## Key skills & Packages
Python: Core programming language used throughout the project.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
JSON: Parsing nested JSON data structures within the dataset.
VSCode and Colab: Development environment used for data processing and initial explorations.
Excel: Source data format, with reading and writing handled by Python libraries.
Sklearn: For Model building, training and evaluation
NumPy: For data processing
SciPy: For statistics
Streamlit: For deploying the App

## üöÄ Approach

### 1. Data Processing
- **Import and Concatenate:** Begin by importing all city-specific datasets, converting them into a structured format, and adding a 'City' column to each dataset. Concatenate all datasets into a single, unified dataset.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Address missing values by filling or removing them, using appropriate techniques like mean, median, or mode imputation for numerical columns and mode imputation for categorical columns.
- **Standardizing Data Formats:** Ensure consistency in data formats, such as converting strings like "70 kms" to integers.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Transform categorical features into numerical values using one-hot encoding for nominal variables and label encoding for ordinal variables.
- **Normalizing Numerical Features:** Scale numerical features to a standard range to improve model performance.
- **Removing Outliers:** Identify and address outliers using techniques like IQR or Z-score analysis to avoid skewing the model.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate summary statistics to understand data distribution, including mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
- **Data Visualization:** Use scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps to uncover patterns and correlations.
- **Feature Selection:** Identify important features through correlation analysis, feature importance from models, and domain knowledge.

### 3. Model Development
- **Train-Test Split:** Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation, using common split ratios like 70-30 or 80-20.
- **Model Selection:** Choose the most suitable machine learning algorithms for price prediction, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting Machines.
- **Model Training:** Train the selected models using cross-validation techniques to ensure robust performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model parameters using Grid Search or Random Search for improved accuracy.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate model performance with metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- **Model Comparison:** Compare different models based on evaluation metrics to select the best-performing one.

### 5. Optimization
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or modify existing ones to boost model performance.
- **Regularization:** Apply regularization techniques like Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) to prevent overfitting.

### 6. Deployment
- **Streamlit Application:** Deploy the final model using Streamlit to create an interactive web application, allowing users to input car features and get real-time price predictions.
- **User Interface Design:** Ensure the application is intuitive and user-friendly, with clear instructions and error handling.

## üéâ Results
- A **functional and accurate machine learning model** for predicting used car prices.
- Comprehensive **analysis and visualizations** of the dataset.
- An **interactive Streamlit application** for real-time price predictions based on user input.
